			<p>The late Derrida penned those words knowing full well that they were just that, penned words.</p>

<p>He must have seen those as an affront to his very ideas, the philosopher’s critique on meta-statements being a meta-statement itself. A critique, so named, because it was long thought (among philosophers) that philosophy was the queen of thought.  She’d ask the most fundamental questions and these questions demanded answers and, as such, demanded an unparalleled gravity. In other words, they set the rules of the game.  Derrida dared to question the question (he was not the first):</p>

<p>The interesting thing is that this gives Being and words (signs of vocables of beings) a strange polarized power. On the one hand, language could become a great means of power for those who best commanded and shaped it, but, on the other, it causes a break between the thing and the thing signified rendering language vacuous. Both ideas have equal merit depending on the presuppositions on is drawing from.</p>

<p>The consequences of these ideas is that there is no privileged, absolute perspective or language that stands above the rest: scientist, philosophers, and theologians command equal power. None trumps the other, instead we are to read each perspective as its own rhetoric in its most unpejorative sense (hopefully).  At least, that is my reading of Derrida.</p>

<p>Regardless of one’s pressuposition, however, it is clear that we live in a world where signs and signs of signs of things capture our imagination. We call there collection <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=media">media</a> and, when we are not consuming it, we are talking about it or trying to monitize it.</p>

<p>If we take David’s argument seriously, then the need to parse and present visual language should be placed in the same category as other forms of language and should be understood as rhetoric, given my current line of thinking. Consequently, the interaction of these things in <strong>media</strong>, which is called <strong>design </strong>demands as much attention as <strong>philosophy</strong> or <strong>science</strong>. <strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>NB: </strong>I was going for brevity over specificity here. There is, obviously, loads to unpack.</p>
