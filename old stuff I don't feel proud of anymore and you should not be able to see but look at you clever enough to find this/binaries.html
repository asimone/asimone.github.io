			<p>Not long after college I had the opportunity to talk to <a href="http://pages.citebite.com/n1h0v5l3q3jpn">Landon Jones</a> who, last I heard, still resides in Princeton. To be honest, I do not remember much of the conversation. I am sure it was good advice but what I most remember is a brief statement he made, “most people, I find, are concerned with either/or when it is often a case of both/and.” Almost obsessively, I have been wondering why someone–anyone–would claim such a thing. Don’t hear what I am not saying: it is perfectly reasonable (and possibly correct) to conclude such a thing, but it does lead one to wonder what sort of suppositions cause the conclusion. Besides, what about the “neither/nor” option?</p>

<p>Upon reflection, I came up with this loose categorization:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>either/or</strong> -- Grounded in the classical thesis/antithesis, those who find this appealing also tend to favor the Greeks and scholastics.</li>
	<li><strong>both/and</strong> -- Hegel synthesis of thesis/antithesis, there is a tendency to prefer historical development.</li>
	<li> <strong>neither/nor</strong> -- Deconstruction,  the desire to step outside of the traditional categories, think outside of the box, distaste with the historical but not for the same reasons as classical thought.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sure these ‘pathologies’ have their problems, but there is merit, no?</p>
