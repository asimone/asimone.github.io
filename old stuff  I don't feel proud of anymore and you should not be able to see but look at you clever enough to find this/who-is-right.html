			<p><strong>Fellow #1:</strong> It seems to me that the end of epistemology is not a justification of how we know, but rather a description of how we know. Further, this is the end of all thought: Description, testing of the description with the thing known/experienced/apprehended, refining of the description, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Fellow #2: </strong>Yes, but this seems to frame all things <em>merely</em> in the subjective. How could we then describe anything? The force of language is only as strong as those who command it. Further, one word means one thing to one man and to another man, something else. We can never be sure of communication.</p>

<p><strong>Fellow #1:</strong> Firstly, your use of “merely” betrays your assumption that the subjective is not really a valid way of knowing, instead the objective trumps all. Secondly, although you demand the objective as <em>the</em> way of knowing, you deny it as a possibility. The reality is that we can only communicate because of commonality in language. This, again, is not an argument but rather a description of this very conversation. We go back and forth assuming —no, understanding that we grasp each others words. Why must we be constrained by the classical dichotomy of subjective/objective?</p>

<p><strong>Fellow #2</strong>: Because that is our historical backdrop. You see, for me there is a leap of faith in language. We assume the other grasps our meaning, we cannot every know for sure because we cannot get into the other persons mind. Subjectivity reigns; consequently, we can neither be certain of communication with those outside of our cultural context, nor legitimately appropriate others myths/religious beliefs.</p>

<p><strong>Fellow #1:</strong> That is just silly.</p>

<p><strong>Fellow #2:</strong> Naming calling won’t sway me.</p>

<p><strong>Fellow #1:</strong> Perhaps, but your recognition of it proves my point.</p>
