			<p>I have complained for years that Salinger has infected my pen and, quite possibly, my tongue (the incessant deferrals, obsessive qualifications, twitchy paretheticals, etc., etc.) for better <em>and</em> ill. But, it was not until I read <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2219768/pagenum/all/">Rosenbaum’s reflection on Salinger’s silence</a> (<a href="http://fimoculous.com">via</a>) that I got a clear (albeit, controversial and guessed) diagnosis of the problem:</p>
<blockquote>There is also a critical difference between the two finicky writers: Nabokov was a <em>finisher</em>. Look how many dozens of books he wrote in two languages in his life. True, he tried to burn <em>Lolita</em>. (It was saved only by his wife.) True, he was a perfectionist, but, I'd argue, one who came to recognize that there was a time finally to publish. That a work was, at a certain point, as perfect—as perfectly Nabokovian—as it would ever get. Salinger seems—in his parentheses-choked later works, at least—to believe he could never get as Salingerian as he wanted. And that his work had to be not as good as <em>he</em> could make it but as good as God could make it. Which suggests nothing can ever be truly finished. Maybe that's his problem.</blockquote>
<p>I’ve come to the conclusion, after far too long, that perfection is simply finishing.</p>
