			<p>There was once a young boy who had to choose between his parents. The boy with his sister was led to the judges chambers and asked, ‘If you had a choice, who would like to live your mother or your father?’</p>

<p>The boy thought to himself, ‘this is an impossible question. A child is supposed to live with both his parents,’ and, while he was mulling this over, his younger sister blurted out, ‘my mother.’</p>

<p>The boy was caught in a quandry. He, after his sister answered, felt a desire to live with his father (for a boy, after all, loves his father in way that he cannot ever love his mother). Yet he did not want to choose between his parents for he loved them both very much. Besides, he was still a naive child who figured this answer was final. This terrified him.</p>

<p>But it was too late: the question had been posed–whether or not he choose to answer the judge–and, in turn, had become a legitimate, academic question (these are the most terrible of ALL questions) in his mind. The boy, thinking it was better that he and his sister live together, made his decision, against his own judgement, and declared that he would prefer to live his mother. And so they did.</p>

<p>‘But teacher,’ said the most beloved disciple, ‘I am unsure whether the boy’s decision was the right choice.’</p>

<p>The teacher said, ‘Dear friend, the boy’s choice is irrelevant. Violence was done when he first began to look at his parents as options.’</p>
